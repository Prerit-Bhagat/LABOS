  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
- **Deadlock**
  - Detection and/or Avoidance (e.g., Banker's Algorithm)

## üß† Algorithm Overview

### üïí FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

- Non-preemptive.
- Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
- Simple but can lead to long waiting times.

### ‚è±Ô∏è SJF (Shortest Job First)

- Non-preemptive.
- Executes the shortest process first.
- Reduces average waiting time but can starve longer processes.

### üîÅ Round Robin

- Preemptive scheduling with a fixed time quantum.
- Each process gets equal time in a cyclic order.
- Good for time-sharing systems.

### ‚ö° Priority Scheduling

#### ‚û§ Non-Preemptive:

- Higher-priority processes are executed first.
- If two processes have the same priority, FCFS is used.

#### ‚û§ Preemptive:

- A higher-priority process can preempt a currently running lower-priority process.
- Fairer in some cases, but more complex.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deadlock Detection / Avoidance

- Detects if a system is in a **deadlock state**.
- May use:
  <!-- - **Wait-for Graph** -->
  - **Banker's Algorithm**
- Can print:
  - Safe sequence (if any)
  - Detected deadlock processes
