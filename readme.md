# OS Scheduling Algorithms & Deadlock Detection

This project contains C++ implementations of core Operating System (OS) concepts including:

- **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
- **Deadlock**
  - Detection and/or Avoidance (e.g., Banker's Algorithm)
